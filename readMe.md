 # Function going behind the Scenes

 => whenever you write your file in html and css then the structure is firstly converted in DOM by browser.
    Tree Data Structure. It is Hirearchy based Data Structure.

 => Breaking the components like div,h1,span in small chunks is called as tokenisation.
=>based on this tokenisation deveral nodes are made and finally DOM tree is made.


# CSS OM --- (CSS OBJECT MODEL)=> TREE BASED D.STRUCTURE  (BOTH ARE INTERMEDIATE STATES)

# CSS OM + DOM  => RENDER TREE

# Event Driven Programming

suppose when user clicks button, mouse hovered, on keypress and many more then this is an event.


## DOMcontentLoaded---------------------> execute our ownlogic
                    when this event is fired


## to manipulate anything on the page we use document which is the importatnt global object and collection of all elements of your code.


# browser Storage

bowser has some small storage capacity inside it , which can be accesed by

localstorage    and with localstorage.setItem("key","value")

and also localstorage.getItem("item_name");
